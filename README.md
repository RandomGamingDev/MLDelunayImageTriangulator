# MLDelunayTriangulation
A short, simple, and sweet ML script that triangulates images by use of Delunay Triangulation. 

This is a python script that converts an image into a series of triangles

How to use the script:
  Start by entering the settings that you want in settings.txt
  The 1st line is for the # of instances
  The 2nd line is for the # of triangles per instance
  The 3rd line is for the # of iterations

  Then after confirming the settings enter the filepath to the image relative to the executable or as a direct filepath

  Then confirm that that's the image that you want

  Wait for the final result in output.jpeg!
