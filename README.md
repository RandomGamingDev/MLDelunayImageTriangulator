# MLDelunayImageTriangulator
A short, simple, and sweet ML script that triangulates images by use of Delunay Triangulation. 
  
This is a python script that converts an image into a series of triangles  
  
How to use the script:  
  Start by entering the settings that you want in settings.txt  
  The 1st line is for the # of instances  
  The 2nd line is for the # of triangles per instance  
  The 3rd line is for the # of iterations  
  
  Then after confirming the settings enter the filepath to the image relative to the executable or as a direct filepath  
  
  Then confirm that that's the image that you want  
  
  Wait for the final result in output.jpeg!  
  
This is for Python 3.9 and requires the following dependencies:   
  pillow,  
  numpy,  
  scipy,  
  matplotlib  
  
It takes a while for the image to generate but you can watch it learn not only in output.jpeg but also on the graph.  
  
This application isn't multithreaded.  
  
Hope you enjoy!
